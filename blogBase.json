By analyzing the connected shaft, the model of the coupling and the wheel was determined. After Assembly, it was found that the coupling of the selected TT motor was too long, so its length was shortened to fit the wheel.\n### Problem 2 : replace with a longer zip tie\n  During assembly, it was found that the purchased zip ties were too short. Some couldn\u2019t be fastened due to space occupied by other components, so longer zip ties were purchased.
