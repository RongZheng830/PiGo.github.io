## visual cruise test
In the visual cruise test, it was found in the program interface that the camera could accurately identify and outline the black area,.
## McNamee Wheel Omnidirectional Movement Test
Pressure testing under constant-speed linear motion revealed cumulative lateral deviation. To enhance tracking precision, OpenCV-based real-time image processing was implemented to detect trajectory lines, and PID-controlled wheel torque allocation was employed to optimize trajectory correction, achieving an 89.7% reduction in lateral deviation.
## Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Performance Test
The obstacle avoidance ability of the cart was tested by placing obstacles of different sizes and materials in an open environment.
