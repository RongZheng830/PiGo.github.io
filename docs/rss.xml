## Step-by-Step Assembly

## Problems encountered 
### Problem 1 : install the caster wheel
  When the materials were delivered, it was discovered that the caster wheel was missing. By analyzing the connected shaft, the model of the coupling and the wheel was determined. After Assembly, it was found that the coupling of the selected TT motor was too long, so its length was shortened to fit the wheel.
### Problem 2 : replace with a longer zip tie
  During assembly, it was found that the purchased zip ties were too short. Some couldn’t be fastened due to space occupied by other components, so longer zip ties were purchased. (2.5*200mm)。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://RongZheng830.github.io/PiGo.github.io/post/The%20Raspberry%20PI%20Car.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 20:13:01 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
